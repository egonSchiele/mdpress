# How to use

Write a Markdown file. Any time you create a horizonal rule `---`, you're signaling the start of a new slide.

# TODO

- add some way to specify data-x, data-y etc through markdown?
- add some way to automatically pull impress.js etc?
- some way to pipe to this instead of reading from a file? (ruby has a shortcut for this)
